# Trade Aggregation
A high performance, modular and flexible trade aggregation crate, producing Candle data, 
suitable for low-latency applications and incremental updates.
It allows the user to choose the rule dictating how a new candle is created 
through the [AggregationRule](src/aggregation_rules/aggregation_rule_trait.rs) trait, 
e.g: Time, Volume based or some other information driven rule.
It also allows the user to choose which type of candle will be created from the aggregation process
through the [ModularCandle](src/modular_candle_trait.rs) trait. Combined with the [Candle](trade_aggregation_derive/src/lib.rs) macro, 
it enables the user to flexibly create any type of Candle as long as each component implements 
the [CandleComponent](src/candle_components/candle_component_trait.rs) trait.

See [MathisWellmann/go_trade_aggregation](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/go_trade_aggregation) for a go implementation with less features and performance.

### How to use:
To use this crate in your project, add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
trade_aggregation = "^3"
```

Lets aggregate all trades into time based 1 minute candles, consisting of open, high, low and close information.
Notice how easy it is to specify the 'AggregationRule' and 'ModularCandle' being used in the process.
One can easily plug in their own implementation of those trait for full customization.

```rust
use trade_aggregation::{
    candle_components::{Close, High, Low, Open},
    *,
};
use trade_aggregation_derive::Candle;

#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, Candle)]
struct MyCandle {
    open: Open,
    high: High,
    low: Low,
    close: Close,
}

fn main() {
    let trades = load_trades_from_csv("data/Bitmex_XBTUSD_1M.csv")
        .expect("Could not load trades from file!");

    // specify the aggregation rule to be time based
    let time_rule = TimeRule::new(M1);
    let mut aggregator = GenericAggregator::<MyCandle, TimeRule>::new(time_rule);

    let candles = aggregate_all_trades(&trades, &mut aggregator);
    println!("got {} candles", candles.len());
}
```

Alternatively, use an online updating approach to update with each tick:

```rust
use trade_aggregation::{
    candle_components::{Close, High, Low, Open},
    *,
};

#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, Candle)]
struct MyCandle {
    open: Open,
    high: High,
    low: Low,
    close: Close,
}

fn main() {
    let trades = load_trades_from_csv("data/Bitmex_XBTUSD_1M.csv")
        .expect("Could not load trades from file!");

    // specify the aggregation rule to be time based
    let time_rule = TimeRule::new(M1);
    let mut aggregator = GenericAggregator::<MyCandle, TimeRule>::new(time_rule);

    for t in &trades {
        if let Some(candle) = aggregator.update(t) {
            println!(
                "candle created with open: {}, high: {}, low: {}, close: {}",
                candle.open(),
                candle.high(),
                candle.low(),
                candle.close()
            );
        }
    }
}
```

See examples folder for more.
Run examples using
```
cargo run --release --example aggregate_all_ohlc
```

### Performance:
To run the benchmarks, written using criterion, run:

```shell
cargo bench
```

Here are some results running on a 12th gen Intel Core i7-12800H, aggregating 1 million trades into 1 minute candles:

Candle | Time
-------|-----------
Open   |  1.8 ms
OHLC   |  7   ms
All    | 16   ms

The more 'CandleComponent's you use, the longer it takes obviously.
